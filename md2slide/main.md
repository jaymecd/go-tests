What do you want to do?
-----------------------


```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

Test line:

```
    XNo language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
    But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```


---

Build it!
---------

    md2slides -o /tmp/slides.html main.md

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
